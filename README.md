# Project 1.2 - Spark Streaming | Distributed Data

Project utilizing Spark to deploy ML models on real-time streamed data from a Kafka server.

# Project 1 - Distributed Data

- Chose to share this project as an example, to reflect my thought process and coding abilities with regards to:

	- Spark
	- Spark Streaming
	- Extracting insights from data
	- Deploying Machine Learning models on Streamed data from a Kafka Server

## Files uploaded

- Data: 1 zipped files. 
	- project_1_2_data: 1 folder containing 1 json file (data.json)

- part1 - 2 files (.ipynb and HTML)
- part2 - Learning Task: 2 files (.py and PDF)
- part3 - (Stream challenge) Extract and Learn: 2 files (.py and PDF)

## How to review

- I recommend starting from reading the project assignment overview guidlines, to understand the project and the data.
- Extract data to review insights and dive into the data set.
- Review Part2 and Part3 PDF files to see the thought process and results acheived from the Streaming challenge
- If your interested in the Streaming challenge alone, skip to part3.

## No code needed review (if you dont want to run any code files or extract zipped data)

- see part1 HTML file
- see part2 PDF file
- see part3 PDF file

Enjoy.
